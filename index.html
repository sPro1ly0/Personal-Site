    I am interested in learning coding and web development. This personal site is my first coding project in HTML. I am also an assistant tennis coach at my former high school for the girl's tennis season this spring. I love tennis and have played

    have fun too! Updates about our tennis matches and scores can be found on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/avontennis?lang=en">@AvonTennis</a>. I love learning about science as well. I graduated last spring from <a
      href="https://www.iupui.edu/">IUPUI</a> with a Biology degree. My favorite topics are
    Microbiology, Immunology, and Developmental Biology or Embryology.
